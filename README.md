# First-Project-In-Go

This project was based on the Alura course: https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/golang.
With occasional changes, so that it stays the way I prefer, this was my first contact with Golang, so there are certainly changes that can be made to make it more enjoyable, this is the first of a series of projects in go that I will be working on implement, wait for news. :)
â€‹
To run the program, you must download the golang dependencies and run the following command: go run check_site_status.go
